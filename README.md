1. Clone the repository
First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Run this command in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/609harsh/Cryptocurrency-Dashboard.git
This will download the project to your current directory.

2. Navigate to the project folder
Change into the newly cloned directory by running:

bash
Copy
cd Cryptocurrency-Dashboard
3. Install dependencies
The project likely has some dependencies that need to be installed. If the project uses Node.js (you can usually find this out by checking for a package.json file in the project folder), you can install dependencies with:

bash
Copy
npm install
If you're using Yarn instead of npm, you can install dependencies with:

bash
Copy
yarn install
4. Run the project
After the dependencies are installed, you can start the application. If the project uses npm, you can run:

bash
Copy
npm start
